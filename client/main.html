                Good news! Your user was authenticated with OAuth2. While the authentication is indication that data
                is being transferred from the resource service using tokens. You can view the results here.
            </p>

                <h3>Step A7 - fetch userId from /api/getUserId</h3>
                <p>
                    This step is also performed server-to-server by the client application and is
                    only done here for testing purposes. Here we are using the newly acquired
                    access token, we retrieve the userId associated with the access token. These two
                    should match.
